The BeesBook system is a state-of-the art system for research into the honeybee \textit(Apis Melifera). It collects data from cameras continuosly observing a beehive. All individuals are marked by tags the system can decode. Its main advantages are extensibility and scale (being able to track an entire colony over its lifetime. In this work I attempt an investigation into the honeybee division of labor, focusing on the transition to foragers (the workers that survey the environment for food and transport it back to the hive). I attempt to conduct it in a way that makes any future examinations of following topics easier and I make recommendations for such methodology.

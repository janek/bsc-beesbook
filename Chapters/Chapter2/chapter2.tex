I present related work in three categories. The first one is an introduction to
invertebrate tracking and automated observation, along with an overview of the
state of the art. 

The second focuses on the division of labor in honeybees. It’s meant to set
foundation for the analysis that we undertake in this work, as well as for
determining what other kinds of approaches should be accessible given the
BeesBook dataset and the building blocks that this work adds to it.

Finally, the last one collects works similar to this contribution - ones that
use the \textit{BeesBook} dataset to perform some analysis of a honeybee
colony’s life and/or add their own functionalities or improvements to the
system.

\section{Invertebrate observation and tracking} 

Observing invertebrates at scale, before a certain degree of automation was
possible, required a lot of careful manual work and some creative approaches. A
fascinating example of how experiments were conducted back then can be found in
\citep{seeley_adaptive_1982}. The authors mark a hundred bees out of a colony of
21 thousand, using a brush with pigment mixed with shellac (following the
example set by Karl Von Frisch \citep{von_frisch_tanzsprache_1965}). They then
pick for observation small subsections of the hive (quadrants), employing the
help of a Texas Instruments calculator to generate randomness for their choices.
Inferences about the entire population are made using the samples, but even to
observe the samples, 8 hours of continuous work per day, for over 20 days, was
necessary. To create maps of activity, authors used glass sheets that they put
markings on and exchanged every day. They then photographed the sheets and
projected the photographs against a single sheet of paper, one by one, thereby
aggregating the one-day information sets into a single map. They also used a
number of other physical and numerical tricks to be able to produce quality
data. 

One step toward an automated process is to take video recordings and analyze
them manually \citep{naug_structure_2008}, also using markings, sometimes such
that identifying a single individual from its marker was possible. This is less
error-prone, but analysis of the film requires no less time than real-time
observation (and often much more). 

Compared to both those methods, modern approaches that analyze video footage
automatically save a tremendous amount of effort. Researchers tend to take one
of two paths: tracking the animals based on their previous positions and body
features or using specialized markers (tags) that are put on individuals for
identification.

A prominent and oft-cited example in unmarked tracking is
\citep{kimura_new_2011}, where good results were achieved in tracking unmarked
honeybees over short periods of time. They system employed was based on vector
quantization and temporal contextual information. It was able to distinguish
between individuals solely based on their body size and movement, keeping track
of 50\% of the hive (~350 bees) over 10 seconds. 

A recent notable work \citep{bozek_pixel_2018} reports maintaining 71\% tracks
for over 2 min, around 46\% for 5mins. Such approaches are impressive
technologically and of great importance by virtue of being generalizable
(authors cite cells in tissues and human crowds as examples of potential usage);
yet on the problem of invertebrate tracking they do not yet achieve the results
of marker-based systems in terms of effectiveness and scale. 

They therefore do not allow for analysis that can draw conclusions relating to
entire lifespans of individuals, or the colony (which is what I am attempting in
this work). For anything related to foraging, systems based on trajectory and
body features are particularly unreliable, as they would inevitably lose track
of individuals\’ identities whenever those would leave the hive and come back.

%%TODO: fix below to be more consistent
A recent experiment with a strong focus on trophallaxis
\citep{gernat_automated_2018} has a lot of similarities to ours in terms of
tracking method. It uses tag markers and tracks multiple bees across a longer
period of time. Being focused on a more specific problem allowed for a more
specialized setup that made tracking easier, but was more intrusive in terms of
how it influenced the bees’ lifes. The hive was single-sided and designed in a
way that prevented the bees from obscuring each others’ barcodes (presumably by
keeping the space between hive surface and glass ceiling small). The hive was
also backlit by infrared light, making the surface easier to distinguish from
the insects. These factors (hopefully) did not have a strong adverse effect on
the relevant data, but would not work for a holistic observation attempted in
BeesBook.

An additional compilation of related work can be found in the attachment section
of \citep{schlegel_temporal_2017}. It collects 14 contributions in a table
format, comparing them with respect to parameters such as species, colony size,
duration of study, and tracking method (manual or automatic). The focus of that
comparison is interaction networks - they do, however, still fulfil the more
general criteria of relevance to invertebrate traching and to the BeesBook project.

BeesBook is a long-running project with work subsequent to the original paper
contributing improvements in the soft- and hardware of the detection stack (Sixt
et al., 2016, Wild et al., 2018, Boenisch et al., 2018), as well as various
applications of its data in collective behaviour and honeybee research (Adrian*
et al, 2018).

This work is meant to add building blocks to the BeesBook system and derive new
abstractions that can be used in future analyses, particularly those pertaining
to the forager transition and the foraging phase of a bee’s life. While no
previous work seems to state that as an explicit goal, a number of them have
made significant contributions as a side effect of their examinations.

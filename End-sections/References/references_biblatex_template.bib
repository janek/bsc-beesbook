	abstract = {Computational approaches to the analysis of collective behavior in social insects increasingly rely on motion paths as an intermediate data layer from which one can infer individual behaviors or social interactions. Honey bees are a popular model for learning and memory. Previous experience has been shown to affect and modulate future social interactions. So far, no lifetime history observations have been reported for all bees of a colony. In a previous work we introduced a tracking system customized to track up to \$4000\$ bees over several weeks. In this contribution we present an in-depth description of the underlying multi-step algorithm which both produces the motion paths, and also improves the marker decoding accuracy significantly. We automatically tracked \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2000\$ marked honey bees over 10 weeks with inexpensive recording hardware using markers without any error correction bits. We found that the proposed two-step tracking reduced incorrect {ID} decodings from initially \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}13{\textbackslash}\%\$ to around \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ post-tracking. Alongside this paper, we publish the first trajectory dataset for all bees in a colony, extracted from \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 4\$ million images. We invite researchers to join the collective scientific effort to investigate this intriguing animal system. All components of our system are open-source.},

We investigated the spatial positions and the association network of workers and the queen in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) society using high-resolution recordings of spatial behaviour and ‘network connections’ at the individual level. Our socio-spatial combined approach highlighted a highly compartmentalised structure inside honeybee colony. Connectivity and spatial overlap are high among same-age workers but low among different-age workers. Foragers are at the periphery of the social network, while the colony core is formed by young bees and the queen.

I checked two predictions of this hypothesis: (1) at each age a worker handles a set of tasks (rather than one task), and (2) the elements of each age's task-set co-occur spatially in the nest (rather than being spatially segregated). Most observations match these predictions, once workers reach the age of 2 days. The unpredicted specialization of 0 to 2-day-old workers on the single task of cell cleaning may reflect an unusual ease in locating work sites for this particular task. There are 5 female castes in honeybee colonies: the queen (reproductive caste), plus 4 age subcastes among the workers (cell cleaning caste, broodnest caste, food storage caste, and forager caste).},

	abstract = {The {BeesBook} system provides high-resolution data about bee movements within a single colony by automatically tracking individual honey bees inside a hive over their entire life. This thesis focuses on the process of designing and implementing a network pipeline to extract interaction networks from this data. Spatial proximity is used as an indicator for interactions between bees. Social network analysis methods were applied to investigate the static and dynamic properties of the resulting social networks of honey bees on a global, intermediate and local level. The resulting networks were characterized by a low hierarchical structure and a high density. The global structure of the colony seems to be stable over time. The local structure is highly dynamic, as bees change communities as they age. Communities in the honey bee network are formed by age groups that show a high spatial fidelity. The findings are in line with the established state of research that colonies are organized around age-based task division. The results of the analysis validate the implemented pipeline and the inferred networks. Consequently, this work provides an excellent
foundation for future research focusing on temporal network analysis.},

	abstract = {Honeybees exhibit two patterns of organization of work. In the spring and summer, division of labor is used to maximize growth rate and resource accumulation, while during the winter, worker survivorship through the poor season is paramount, and bees become generalists. This work proposes new organismal and proximate level conceptual models for these phenomena. The first half of the paper presents a push–pull model for temporal polyethism. Members of the nursing caste are proposed to be pushed from their caste by the development of workers behind them in the temporal caste sequence, while middle-aged bees are pulled from their caste via interactions with the caste ahead of them. The model is, hence, an amalgamation of previous models, in particular, the social inhibition and foraging for work models. The second half of the paper presents a model for the proximate basis of temporal polyethism. Temporal castes exhibit specialized physiology and switch caste when it is adaptive at the colony level. The model proposes that caste-specific physiology is dependent on mutually reinforcing positive feedback mechanisms that lock a bee into a particular behavioral phase. Releasing mechanisms that relate colony level information are then hypothesized to disrupt particular components of the priming mechanisms to trigger endocrinological cascades that lead to the next temporal caste. Priming and releasing mechanisms for the nursing caste are mapped out that are consistent with current experimental results. Less information-rich, but plausible, mechanisms for the middle-aged and foraging castes are also presented.},

Here we consider why foragers follow dances and discuss the function of the dance as a multicomponent signal. We argue that the ‘dance language’ is just one information component of the waggle dance and that the two terms should not be used synonymously. We propose that location information is often backup information to be used in case information acquired directly from the environment about food sources is not available, is of poor quality or is associated with unprofitable food sources.},

	abstract = {A computer program that tracks animal behavior, thereby revealing various features and mechanisms of social animals, is a powerful tool in ethological research. Because honeybee colonies are populated by thousands of bees, individuals co-exist in high physical densities and are difficult to track unless specifically tagged, which can affect behavior. In addition, honeybees react to light and recordings must be made under special red-light conditions, which the eyes of bees perceive as darkness. The resulting video images are scarcely distinguishable. We have developed a new algorithm, K-Track, for tracking numerous bees in a flat laboratory arena. Our program implements three main processes: (A) The object (bee’s) region is detected by simple threshold processing on gray scale images, (B) Individuals are identified by size, shape and spatiotemporal positional changes, and (C) Centers of mass of identified individuals are connected through all movie frames to yield individual behavioral trajectories. The tracking performance of our software was evaluated on movies of mobile multi-artificial agents and of 16 bees walking around a circular arena. K-Track accurately traced the trajectories of both artificial agents and bees. In the latter case, K-track outperformed Ctrax, well-known software for tracking multiple animals. To investigate interaction events in detail, we manually identified five interaction categories; ‘crossing’, ‘touching’, ‘passing’, ‘overlapping’ and ‘waiting’, and examined the extent to which the models accurately identified these categories from bee’s interactions. All 7 identified failures occurred near a wall at the outer edge of the arena. Finally, K-Track and Ctrax successfully tracked 77 and 60 of 84 recorded interactive events, respectively. K-Track identified multiple bees on a flat surface and tracked their speed changes and encounters with other bees, with good performance.},

Typically, observables such as waggle durations or body angles are extracted manually either directly from the observation hive or from video recordings to quantify properties of the dance and related behaviors. In recent years, biology has profited from automation, improving measurement precision, removing human bias, and accelerating data collection. We have developed technologies to track all individuals of a honeybee colony and to detect and decode communication dances automatically. In strong contrast to conventional approaches that focus on a small subset of the hive life, whether this regards time, space, or animal identity, our more inclusive system will help the understanding of the dance comprehensively in its spatial, temporal, and social context. In this contribution, we present full specifications of the recording setup and the software for automatic recognition of individually tagged bees and the decoding of dances. We discuss potential research directions that may benefit from the proposed automation. Lastly, to exemplify the power of the methodology, we show experimental data and respective analyses from a continuous, experimental recording of 9 weeks duration.},

Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the hive bee to forager transition holds a prominent position within present day sociobiology. Here we suggest a new explanation dubbed the ‘‘double repressor hypothesis’’ aimed to account for the substantial amount of empirical data in this ﬁeld. This is the ﬁrst time where both the regular transition and starvation-induced precocious transition are explained within the same regulatory framework. We suggest that the transition is under regulatory control by an internal and an external repressor of the allatoregulatory central nervous system, where these two repressors modulate a positive regulatory feedback loop involving juvenile hormone ({JH}) and the lipoprotein vitellogenin. The concepts of age-neutrality, ﬁxed and variable response thresholds and reinforcement are integral parts of our explanation, and in addition they are given explicit physiological content. The hypothesis is represented by a differential equations model at the level of the individual bee, and by a discrete individual-based colony model. The two models generate predictions in accordance with empirical data concerning the cumulative probability of becoming a forager, mean age at onset of foraging, reversal of foragers, time window of reversal, relationship between {JH} titre and onset of foraging, relative representations of genotypic groups, and effects of forager depletion and conﬁnement.},

	abstract = {The roots of swarm intelligence are deeply embedded in the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects. From the routing of trafﬁc in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research ﬁeld. For the ﬁrst issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects’ colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the underlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems. We emphasize in particular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system’s parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we address the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall ﬂexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that future studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the honeybee has emerged as an excellent model for molecular and genetic studies of complex social behaviors. By using the global gene expression methods as well as the candidate gene approach, it is now possible to link the function of genes to social behaviors. In this paper, I discuss the ﬁndings about one such gene, foraging, a {cGMP}-dependent protein kinase. The involvement of this gene in regulating division of labor is discussed on two independent, but not mutually exclusive levels; the possible mechanisms for {PKG} action in regulating behavioral transitions associated with honeybee division of labor, and its possible involvement in the evolution of division of labor in bees.},

	abstract = {The burgeoning field of invertebrate behavior is moving into what was the realm of human psychology concepts. This invites comparative studies not only between invertebrate and vertebrate species but also among the diverse taxa within the invertebrates, diverse even when considering only the insects. In order to make lasting progress two issues must be addressed. The first is inconsistent use of fundamental terms defining learning. The second is a focus on similarities, giving little attention to dissimilarities. In addition, much work is needed on whether behavioral similarities are grounded in the same neuronal architecture when considering disparate phyla. These concerns identify are “inconvenient truths” that weaken comparative behavioral analysis.},

	abstract = {Tracking large numbers of densely-arranged, interacting objects is challenging due to occlusions and the resulting complexity of possible trajectory combinations, as well as the sparsity of relevant, labeled datasets. Here we describe a novel technique of collective tracking in the model environment of a 2D honeybee hive in which sample colonies consist of \$N{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}3\$ highly similar individuals, tightly packed, and in rapid, irregular motion. Such a system offers universal challenges for multi-object tracking, while being conveniently accessible for image recording. We first apply an accurate, segmentation-based object detection method to build initial short trajectory segments by matching object configurations based on class, position and orientation. We then join these tracks into full single object trajectories by creating an object recognition model which is adaptively trained to recognize honeybee individuals through their visual appearance across multiple frames, an attribute we denote as pixel personality. Overall, we reconstruct {\textasciitilde}46\% of the trajectories in 5 min recordings from two different hives and over 71\% of the tracks for at least 2 min. We provide validated trajectories spanning 3000 video frames of 876 unmarked moving bees in two distinct colonies in different locations and filmed with different pixel resolutions, which we expect to be useful in the further development of general-purpose tracking solutions.},

	abstract = {Flying honey bees have among the highest mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates ever measured, suggesting that their ﬂight muscles may experience high levels of oxidative stress during normal daily activities. We measured parameters of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in highly metabolic ﬂight muscle and less active head tissue in cohorts of age-matched nurse bees, which rarely ﬂy, and foragers, which ﬂy several hours per a day. Naturally occurring foraging ﬂight elicited an increase in ﬂight muscle Hsp70 content in both young and old foragers; however catalase and total antioxidant capacity increased only in young ﬂight muscle. Surprisingly, young nurse bees also showed a modest daily increase in Hsp70, catalase levels and antioxidant capacity, and these eﬀects were likely due to collecting the young nurses soon after orientation ﬂights. There were no diﬀerences in ﬂight muscle carbonyl content over the course of daily activity and few diﬀerences in Hsp70, catalase, total antioxidant capacity and protein carbonyl levels in head tissue regardless of age or activity. In summary, honey bee ﬂight likely produces high levels of reactive oxygen species in ﬂight muscle that, when coupled with age-related decreases in antioxidant activity may be responsible for behavioral senescence and reduced longevity.},

Bees experienced a constant probability of death per unit time away from the colony. This leads to a log-linear survivorship curve of type {II}. Most bees died before reaching senescence. The patterns of survivorship are likely to influence the evolution of foraging behavior, and this result suggests that age-independent factors such as predation could play a strong role in selection of foraging range and other parameters. Our result is contrary to the pattern expected if the survivorship of individual honey bee foragers is determined largely by a limited lifetime budget of energy expenditure, which would imply a low probability of mortality early in a bee’s foraging life, followed by a sharp increase in mortality late in life, when either physiological or mechanical wear cause death.},
